            The No Estimates game allows you to explore, in a fun and competitive way, sources
            of variation that render estimation inaccurate. It can be played by anything up to
            50 people in 6 teams, and is an ideal way to get these concepts across to
            managers or directors in a remote workshop environment. Ultimately, it
            provides a more scientific approach to forecasting the question every PM asks -
            "When will my stuff be delivered?.

            The classic "Survival at Sea" team-building exercise - you're lost at sea
            in a sinking yacht with a fairly random selection of items, and you have
            to decide which ones you should keep, and which to discard.

            The classic battleships game with an agile twist! Thsi version demonstrates the value of frequent and
            early feedback; one of the players plays "waterfall" and only sees which ships they have hit at the end of the game.
            The other plays "agile", and (<i>as in the normal game</i>) gets feedback on the success of every shot
            immediately after firing.

            In any reasonably sized organisation, there

            from Agile Cambridge 2017 for an explanation.

          <p>
            Pairing is usually touted in XP terms as a way to improve code quality through practices like
            TDD. However, it is a great way to increase knowledge sharing, and therefor reducing risk
            of silos, and for cementing a common vision, approach, goals and practices. But does it take
            longer to develop using pairing? This simulation allows you to explore the true costs and
            benefits of pairing.
