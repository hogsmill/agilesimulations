Status update 06/04/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

Some of the graphs have been updated to make them easier to read; Cycle Time is now ordered by days taken to make it more obvious what's happening, and the Scatter Plot now has the 75%, 90% and 95% lines superimposed to make reading it easier.

We've also added in the ability to change currency of the reports, etc. to allow some internationalisation.

Sessions

Two No Estimates sessions this week for attendees of the CTO Craft Com conference - https://conference.ctocraft.com/. We're also running two Coin Game workshops for the same conference. A good week for game-based mindset change...

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
