Status update 10/05/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

Pipeline Game

If you're interested, we're running a test session of the MVP (hopefully V!) on Friday 14th of May. Get in contact if you;d to play or observe. We're very keen to get early feedback on this new game.

Kanban Playground

The Kanban playground is basically No Estimates with the estimation stuff stripped out, and exra features added - hard and soft WIP, expedite lanes, backlog creation, etc. etc. to allow you to explore different policies and settings without using your "real" boards. Stil not completely finished. but feel free to have a play and let us know what else you need. https://agilesimulations.co.uk/kanban-playground/?host

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
