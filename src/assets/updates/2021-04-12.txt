Status update 13/04/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

Not much to see this week, but a lot behind the scenes stuff this week to improve deployment and update of dedicated servers for paid versions of the games and more monitoring in place to auto-detect and fix some tech debt issues.

Sessions

Two No Estimates, and two Coin Game sessions last week for attendees of the CTO Craft Com conference - https://conference.ctocraft.com/. Some great learnings good fun playing with small groups. 

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
