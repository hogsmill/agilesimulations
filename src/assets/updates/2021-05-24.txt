Status update 24/05/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

The big news this week is that Agile Simulations is now a limited company! This will make no difference to our pricing etc., but should make it easier to purchase/licence our services and products; many organisations won't deal with individuals.

The next public running of No Estiates wil be at Gamify IT on 12/6/21; watch this space for more details.

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
