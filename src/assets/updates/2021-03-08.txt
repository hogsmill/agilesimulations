Status update 08/03/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

We have a new visualisation that shows the flow efficiency of selected cards to highlight how much waiting time can happen during a card's time in play.

We are also thinking about how we might run the game once (some) people go back to the office and want to do it face-to-face. We are developing an app to  allow this, so watch this space.

Public Sessions

We will be running a No Estimates session at this year's Tri Agile conference on 23rd March. See you there. https://triagile.com/

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
