Status update 15/03/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

No Estimates mobile is now available, so we can run the game face-to-face if groups want to play in the office. Obviously, this opens up the possibility of teams playing face-to-face in seperate offices; great for breaking down barriers between teams in a cost-effective manner.

In technical news, we have implemented a new message bus which will improve stability uder stress.

Public Sessions

We will be running a No Estimates session at this year's Tri Agile conference on 23rd March. See you there. https://triagile.com/

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
