Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

Two excellent sessions last week (Tri Agile 2021 and a corporate agile community event) with some great learnings for both particiapnts and ourselves. One thing we learned; we need to know when people leave the game (for whatever reason), so we've updated the game to show this.

Two sessions next week for attendees of the CTO Craft Com conference - https://conference.ctocraft.com/

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
