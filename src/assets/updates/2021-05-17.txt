Status update 17/05/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

Pipeline Game

A first playing of the MVP of this game really gave us some excellent feedback last week. A long way to go, but the concept seems of enough interest to start making this into a full-blown game. 

Look out for future runnings of new iterations!

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
