Status update 15/02/2021

Welcome to the first weekly (hopefully) status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

The No Estimates game was played last week at Agile 20 Reflect with a truly international set of players. Lots of positive feedback and excellent discussion. New graphs have been added; monte carlo simulation, WIP and cumulative flow. As with al graphsm these are based on actual game data; no potted perfect graphs to make the point here!

Coin Game

The Coin Game has had a bit of a revamp, and some bugs with game set up fixed. As with all games, feedback is welcomed and encouraged

Planning Poker

This also has a new look, and a more robust game set up

General

All apps now use socket.io 3.0+which is more secure and reliable across all browsers.

New Stuff

We're currently developing the Interdependent Teams simulaiton into an interactive game. Watch this space!

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using thr games as part of your training/work.
