Status update 21/06/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

We were unable to find tie to report last week - we were actually using the games, for the first ever, as part of a training course for a client! Exciting times! They went down really well, and we learned a lot. 

The next public running of No Estimates wil be on Tuesday 22/6 at Chris Stone's Agile Arcade. Honoured to be asked to do this by the godfather of onine games and retros.

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
