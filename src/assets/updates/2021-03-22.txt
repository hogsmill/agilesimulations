Status update 22/03/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

No Estimates

OK, I'll admit this one is a bit geeky, and some might even say "nice-to-have", but we now generate QR codes on the fly rather than hard wiring. Could be useful if we ever move servers, or build a company-specific site.

We are also plannng our first agile coaches training session to tran coaches in the use and facilitation of the game. Please get in touch if this is something you'd be interested in.

Public Sessions

We will be running a No Estimates session at this year's Tri Agile conference on 23rd March. See you there. https://triagile.com/

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
