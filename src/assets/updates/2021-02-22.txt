Status update 22/02/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

HTTPS

We've upgraded to https on all Agile Simulations apps. This has helped stability, particularly in corporate environments, and we've confirmed it fixes known issue with previous game players.

Kanban Zone

We're delighted to have a blog post on our experiences of bringing workshops online on the Kanban Zone - https://kanbanzone.com/2021/what-we-learned-from-taking-agile-workshops-online/ - It's based on our Agile 20 Reflect experiences, and it includes some fascinating insights form the game we played there.

No Estimates

A 50 player game overnight UK time for the Project Management Institute in Washington, USA went down extremely well, and a great time had by all. 

New Stuff

We're still developing the Interdependent Teams simulation into an interactive game. Watch this space! Also we've done work on the Kanban Playground, and we'd still welcome ideas as to which direction we should take this.

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
