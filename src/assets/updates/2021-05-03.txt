Status update 03/05/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

Kanban Playground

The Kanban playground is basically No Estimates with the estimation stuff stripped out, and exra features added - hard and soft WIP, expedite lanes, backlog creation, etc. etc. to allow you to explore different policies and settings without using your "real" boards. Stil not completely finished. but feel free to have a play and let us know what else you need. https://agilesimulations.co.uk/kanban-playground/?host

Pipeline Game

This new game is coming aling well, and we're looking for early feedback. If you're interested, we'd love to run you through what we have so far. As a concept, it's pretty cool but is it enough of a "game"?

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
