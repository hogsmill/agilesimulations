Status update 07/06/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

The past couple of weeks have been spent re-building the web site - https://agilesimulations.co.uk - to make it easier to understand, navigate and use. All comments welcome. It's still very orange, obviously... :-)

We've also re-vamped te Context Switching game - https://agilesimulations.co.uk/context-switching/?walkThrough - to make it more user friendly. Feel free to have a play.

The next public running of No Estimates wil be at Gamify IT on 12/6/21; watch this space for more details.

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
