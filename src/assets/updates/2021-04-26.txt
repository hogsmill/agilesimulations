Status update 26/04/2021

Welcome to the weekly status update to everyone interested in the progress at Agile Simuations. We've been busy...

This week, we've been concentrating on a new game - The Pipeline Game. This is a game to explore whether we should get rid of all bugs in the software before we deliver it, or deliver rapidly to fix bugs as they are found. Which is best in terms of customer satisfaction, learnings and quality? The game allows you to explore different strategies to see the effect on these things. As with all games, it is highly configurable to best fit your organisation/domain.

Watch this space for more details, beta-testing opportunities and release date...

As ever, feedback on all apps is welcomed, and get in touch for more info, or to discuss faciltation or using the games as part of your training/work.
